# Organizational planning

[![Gitter](https://img.shields.io/gitter/room/neo-chem/org)](https://gitter.im/neo-chem-organising/community)

This repository is a place to plan and solidify ideas about data management in chemistry and related fields, primarily following discussions that occurred at the Chemical Science Symposium 2020: _How can machine learning and autonomy accelerate chemistry?_.

It was suggested that the community should try to centralize efforts on a common core schema for data, that focusses on interoperability and openess. Mechanisms for other parties to extend, re-use and adapt these schemas can then be codified.

The aim of this repository (and GitHub organisation more broadly) is to provide a version controlled "scratchpad" for discussion, ideas and organisation.
All content and names are placeholders until otherwise decided.

There is a [Gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/neo-chem-organising/community) associated with this repository that can be used for informal discussions (and potentially more in the future); this may be replaced by a Slack or another service.

## To-do

I'll try to summarise the possible to-do list that we discussed:

- [ ] Collect interested parties, via email and so-on, and establish a focal point for dicussion.
- [ ] If this GitHub is not the place, then potentially make a Slack or otherwise. One option may be to request a forum on the new [matsci.org platform](https://matsci.org/).
- [ ] Find out who has the time to contribute, and in what ways
- [ ] Potentially prepare a perspective paper as a "call-to-arms" for improved data standards.

## Contributing

All ideas and suggested changes are welcome, please submit a pull request!

## Code of Conduct

This will need to be decided on by the community. As a placeholder, we adopt the Code of Conduct from the Contributor Covenant, found in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

- [Blue Obelisk on Github](https://blueobelisk.github.io/):
- [cheminfo](https://github.com/cheminfo): community on GitHub and their ELN (with option to export data to Zenodo, there is a well-defined structure to the JSON), one instance hosted on [C6H6](https://www.c6h6.org/).
- [LabTrove](http://labtrove.org/about/): chemistry ELN/"Smart Research Framework" (potentially defunct)
- [Chemotion](https://chemotion.net/): ELN focussed on organic chemistry.
- [Chemical Analysis Metadata Platform](http://champ-project.org/): Defined metadata and ontology for chemical analysis.
- [Open Reaction Database](https://github.com/Open-Reaction-Database): Conner Coley, Abby Doyle, Pfityer, Merck and Google work on a protobuffer schema for a chemical reactions database.
